# Project 2
Welcome to Project 2! Our team has embarked on redesigning a class-assigned, poorly designed website. Through applying human-computer interaction and user experience principles, our goal is to make these essential services more accessible and engaging. We've chosen three pages for a makeover: two content pages, including the homepage, and one process page, like a signup form, emphasizing a mobile-first, responsive design. Our approach included a user-centered task analysis, applying design principles for a visually appealing interface, and writing clear text content.
